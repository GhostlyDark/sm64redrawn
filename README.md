This is the result of many hours of manual work drawing these textures at 10x scale or higher.

### Installation

Extract the zip file and copy it's contents into the `res` directory inside your `build` directory.

If asked to write into subdirectories and overwrite files hit yes. This way you'll get all the textures that have been redrawn, while leaving the originals that haven't been redrawn yet intact.
